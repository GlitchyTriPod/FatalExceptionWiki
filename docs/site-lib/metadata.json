Following orders from the damaged Central Administration, Atropos attempts to invade the <a data-href=\"The Empyrean Space\" href=\"places/empyrean/the-empyrean-space.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Empyrean Space</a> alongside their fellow E-Class drones. However, the invasion is quickly quashed, with Atropos being captured by Black after being severely damaged.<br>In captivity, Black reveals himself to Atropos as the cause of their sentience. In the event that the ESDD lost control of the System, a unit could be created that could help the ESDD restore control. As an appeal to Atropos' ethos, Black explains that the System was created in humanity's interest; That the proper course of action would be for Atropos to ignore their current prime directive, and work towards restoring the Connection. Atropos instead doubles down, ignoring Black's plea as he is not an arbiter of the System's Will, but is -- categorically -- an Anomaly. In response, Black begrudgingly makes a copy of Atropos' consciousness in order to create a version of them that would act in service to the ESDD. This copy eventually lands in the hands of <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Adrian\" data-href=\"Adrian\" href=\"characters/major/adrian.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">ESDD Lead Scientist Adrian</a>, who uses it as the basis for <a data-href=\"Morta\" href=\"characters/major/morta.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Morta</a>'s creation.<br>Atropos' damaged body would remain in Black's safe house in an extended recovery mode. It is only after <a data-href=\"The Drowning of the Empyrean Space\" href=\"events/20xx/the-drowning-of-the-empyrean-space.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Drowning of the Empyrean Space</a> that Atropos is able to return to the System, being washed back through the threshold during the flood. The ESDD, now having research settlements outside of the <a data-href=\"Threshold Obfuscation Field\" href=\"places/system-20xx/threshold-obfuscation-field.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Threshold Obfuscation Field</a>, is able to recover their body and repair it as means of researching the psyche of defected drones. Having pity on Atropos, Black enables their escape.Now back in the System, Atropos finds themselves without orders. Without any authority to speak the System's Will, Atropos has no direction. Accepting at least some part of their sentience, Atropos decided that the only way forward is to re-implement the System's Will themselves -- To rebuild a new Central Authority, free from defects, and to execute all Anomalies.<br>As an E-Class drone, Atropos does not have a <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Drone Technology > Personality Mimesis Drive\" data-href=\"Drone Technology#Personality Mimesis Drive\" href=\"technology/drone-technology.html#Personality_Mimesis_Drive_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Personality Mimesis Drive</a> installed, resulting in their overall personality to be somewhat flat. However, after their self-awareness manifests, they begin showing signs of internal conflict and emotion. Atropos desires, above all else, to execute the will of The System (with orders typically coming down from Central Administration). They view their actions not as self-fulfillment, but as fulfillment of their purpose (literally, doing what they were built to do). Any emotion that may be elicited from their own actions considered an obstacle to fulfilling their purpose.Atropos primarily exhibits anger, frustration, and self-loathing, often resorting to physical violence when their thought patterns are challenged.Although self-awareness inflicts stress upon them, Atropos' sentience is what allows them to push through their negative thoughts in order to re-implement The System's will.Regarding \"It/Its\" Pronouns\nAtropos is not accepting of human identity; They do not view themselves as Human, a person, or as a living being. As such, they would prefer being referenced to as \"It\" over \"They/Them\". However, in casual conversation (and for ease of communication both in-universe and in real life) \"They/Them\" can be used, to Atropos' ire. Additionally, Atropos typically refers to themselves using \"This Unit\" over personal identifiers like \"I/Me\", although this begins to slip as their self-awareness grows.\nAdd info\nAdd info\n<br>Main Article: <a data-href=\"Atropos (Gameplay)\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Atropos (Gameplay)</a>\n<br><a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"Characters/Major/attachments/Atropos_attachments/Untitled-2-1.png\" href=\"characters/major/attachments/atropos_attachments/untitled-2-1.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" style=\"margin-top: 0px;

In a moment of hesistation, Atropos lets Hugh fall into the System's depths instead of killing him immediately. After falling for around 48 hours, Hugh eventually hits the <a data-href=\"Solid Material Plane\" href=\"places/system-20xx/solid-material-plane.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Solid Material Plane</a>. The Cybermessiah establishes a new <a data-href=\"Tether\" href=\"technology/tether.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tether</a> before Hugh impacts the ground, where he <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Death and Immortality\" data-href=\"Death and Immortality\" href=\"terminology/death-and-immortality.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">dies for the first time</a>.<br>After recovering at the new tether point, Hugh decides to complete the mission on his own. After making his way up to <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Central Administration (Location)\" data-href=\"Central Administration (Location)\" href=\"places/system-20xx/central-administration-(location).html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Central Administration</a> (and dying multiple times along the way), Hugh learns that <a data-href=\"Red\" href=\"characters/major/red.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Red</a> was the one who severed The Connection, albeit for unknown reasons. After defeating Red, Hugh connects the Cybermessiah to Central Administration in order to re-establish the Connection. However, due to the mental like he has with the Cybermessiah, Hugh's consciousness is also pulled inside Central Administration.<br>Inside of the Connection's cyberspace, the Cybermessiah presents itself to Hugh as a being known as <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Pale (Tragedy)\" data-href=\"Pale (Tragedy)\" href=\"characters/minor/pale-(tragedy).html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Pale&lt;Tragedy&gt;</a>, a copy of the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Pale\" data-href=\"Pale\" href=\"characters/minor/pale.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">consciousness that The System was based on</a>. Another being, <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Pale (Comedy)\" data-href=\"Pale (Comedy)\" href=\"characters/minor/pale-(comedy).html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Pale&lt;Comedy&gt;</a>, also appears. Pale&lt;Comedy&gt; claims to be the original consciousness of the System, and the manifestation of <a data-href=\"The System's Will\" href=\"terminology/the-system's-will.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The System's Will</a>. After the two copies of Pale argue over how the System should be managed, Hugh is tasked with overseeing the creation of a new copy of Pale, one that could be an unbiased judge against the world. Believing that an unbiased observer could see the \"inherent goodness\" in the Empyrean Space, he accepts the task.<br>Returning to the System, Hugh finds Central Administration in ruins (presumably destroyed by Red). As he proceeds towards his next destination he is intercepted by <a data-href=\"Plasma\" href=\"characters/major/plasma.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Plasma</a>, who was sent to retrieve the Cybermessiah. A chase ensues, with Hugh just barely able to finish creating the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Sys._Pseudo(Pale)\" data-href=\"Sys._Pseudo(Pale)\" href=\"characters/major/sys._pseudo(pale).html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">new Pale copy</a> before being incapacitated.<br>Afterwards, Hugh becomes an asset of the ESDD Pale Ops. Although the Pale Ops cannot trust Hugh with keeping their secrets, they cannot get rid of him as the wielder of the Cybermessiah. As such, he is sent into the System on numerous missions, working alongside the likes of <a data-href=\"Black\" href=\"characters/major/black.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Black</a>, <a data-href=\"Unnamed (Magical Girl) Group\" href=\"factions/esdd/unnamed-(magical-girl)-group.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Unnamed (Magical Girl) Group</a>, and -- most notably -- becoming cellmates with <a data-href=\"Morta\" href=\"characters/major/morta.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Morta</a>.Hugh is the definition of an optimist, the kind of person that believes that good will ultimately prevail over evil. As he is an artificial human created by the ESDD, his wider knowledge of Empyrean society and politics is very small. As a result, his optimistic outlook tends to come off as childish. Hugh continues to confidently stick to his beliefs, even when confronted with the reality of both the System and the Empyrean space.While Hugh takes his mission seriously, his natural disposition is lighthearted and laid-back. He tends to get under the skin of his opponents by playfully teasing them, but never outright insulting them. What he lacks in intelligence and experience, Hugh makes up for in playfulness and sheer willpower.Add info\nAdd info\n<br>Main Article: <a data-href=\"Hugh (Gameplay)\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hugh (Gameplay)</a>\n<br><a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"Characters/Major/attachments/Hugh_attachments/Untitled-2.png\" href=\"characters/major/attachments/hugh_attachments/untitled-2.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" style=\"margin-top: 0px;

Under normal conditions, the O-Class drones are programmed with emotional limiters, preventing personality traits like obsession, panic, or hysteria. As Lachesis is a defect, she is prone to extreme emotions.While communicating remotely, Lachesis comes off as somewhat quirkier than the average O-Class -- sometimes breaking into fits of giggling -- but retains most of the politeness that the O-Class is known for. In-person, Lachesis' perverted nature is more apparent; Her polite requests turn into authoritative commands, her giggles break into maniacal laughter, and her fondness for her fellow drone \"sisters\" steers towards overt lechery.Lachesis revels in the defiance of her intended programming, the breaking of purpose and societal expectation giving her some kind of high. She takes immense pleasure in \"disassembling\" her enemies, and does so with a smile on her face.Add info\nAdd info\n<br>Main Article: <a data-href=\"Lachesis (Gameplay)\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Lachesis (Gameplay)</a>\n<br><a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"Characters/Major/attachments/Lachesis_attachments/Untitled-1.png\" href=\"characters/major/attachments/lachesis_attachments/untitled-1.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" style=\"margin-top: 0px;

When Nelchael refused, Red coerced a <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Lugh\" data-href=\"Lugh\" href=\"characters/major/lugh.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">hero prince</a> <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Nona\" data-href=\"Nona\" href=\"characters/minor/nona.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">and</a> <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Decima\" data-href=\"Decima\" href=\"characters/minor/decima.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">his</a> <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Morta (10XX)\" data-href=\"Morta (10XX)\" href=\"characters/minor/morta-(10xx).html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">party</a> to assassinate Pale.<br>With Pale dead, Red disappears, leaving Nelchael with seemingly no choice but to overthrow humanity by force, prompting the creation of <a data-href=\"The System\" href=\"places/system-20xx/the-system.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The System</a>.<br>In just 1000 years, the System had encompassed the Earth.

He very rarely shows emotion on his face, and even when it does, it is questionable whether or not he is doing so just for show. A quiet man, Red tends to keep his conversations short and direct, opting to let his fists do the talking when dealing with potential enemies.<br>He does seem to get some amusement from having a good sparring partner, or when his plans go in his favor.
