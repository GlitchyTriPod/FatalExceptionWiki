# The Four Immortal Beings
<sup>*A questionable existence.*</sup>

In a time before time itself -- before beginnings and endings -- [[The Author]] created Death, bringing an end to nothingness. In Death's wake, the universe was created. The Author wrote that the universe would, eventually, return to Death; And that by returning to Death, the universe would be reborn. And so, the universal cycle of death and rebirth was created.

Death looked over the universal cycle; A witness to the rise and fall of matter, life, and civilization, Death eventually found themselves lonely. So, they split themselves into four parts: [[White]], who represented the desire for nations to conquer one another, [[Red]], the spirit of warfare and bloodshed, [[Black]], the essence of decay and pestilence, and [[Pale]], who would represent finality -- and inherit Death's soul.

## *History*
Over countless eons, the Four Immortal Beings have experienced variation after variation of universes from the perspective -- and form -- of the [[Chosen Civilization]]. Following [[The Four Immortal Beings#***Regarding "Compulsion"***|compulsion]], they commit the atrocities they represent, fulfilling Death's purpose of bringing finality to the living.

At the end of the [[Previous Cycles|previous universe]], White had become the undying Emperor of that universe's Chosen Civilization: The [[Elioud]]. With Red and Black out of the picture, White was able to develop a technology she had sought for a long time; A way to survive the rebirth of the universe.

With this new technology, White was able to bring the strength of her empire into the new cycle. To Red -- who values even conflict -- this was an unfair advantage. As such, he dedicates himself to wiping out the Elioud empire, creating the chaos that led to the creation of [[The System]].

Black, after working through [[Black's Wife|his grief]], decides to ally himself with [[Nelchael]] and the [[Empyrean Space Department of Defense]]. He recognized the need to eliminate White's rule, and was morally aligned with Nelchael's intention of improving life for humanity (albeit unaligned with his methodology).

Pale, as the inheritor of Death's consciousness, tries to remain apart from the other three's business, opting to continue their initial role as a silent observer. Unfortunately for them, their presence as Death's avatar results in them becoming a [[Placenta of the Fourth|valuable resource]] for whoever seeks Death's power. After they are found on Earth, Red is quick to assassinate them, prompting Nelchael and [[Adrian]] to begin the creation of the System.

##### ***Regarding "Compulsion"***
The Immortals aren't mindless creatures. Being capable of conscious thought, they are susceptible to persuasion, emotional outburst, and opinion. In the previous universe, Black found himself enamored with an [[Black's Wife|Elioud woman]], with which he had an intimate relationship with. As a result of this relationship -- and of his grief when his wife eventually died -- Black realized the importance of life, vowing to overcome his compulsion.
