# Drone Technology
The [[System Drones]] are the semi-autonomous force that carries out all processes within [[The System]] that either cannot be done by autonomous means, or requires high-level abstract/lateral thinking in order to complete. Designed by [[Adrian]] to replicate -- and replace -- human labor with agents that were more obedient and less needy, while also being personable (enough) to interact positively with human populations. 

#### ***Ananke Model***
Most drones are derived from a base original model known as "Ananke", an early prototype that did not have a [[Mental Constructs|Mental Construct]] integrated into its internal processes. With a Construct loaded into its programming, the Ananke was able to perform a wide variety of tasks. This could be further aided by adding physical augmentations to the base model, giving way to future models within the three drone Classifications.

The Ananke's Mental Construct is based off of [[Nona]]'s consciousness after her capture in [[Timeline of 10XX|10XX]].

## Drone Classifications

### *C-Class*
Construction Class ("C-Class") drones are the most common classification of drone, and are responsible for all construction processes within the System. Majority of the C-Class is populated with the versatile Ananke model drones, which are capable of utilizing tools made for humans including machinery and vehicles. Additionally, Ananke models have the capability of being quickly reassigned to E-Class if needed. In the event of the [[Elioud]]'s arrival, most of the C-Class would be converted to E-Class drones.

#### ***Clotho Model***
An additional model, unique to the C-Class is the [[Clotho]] model drone. Equipped with heavy duty DC dual-servo joints for strength and dexterity, as well as a high-powered [[Drone Technology#*Hydraulic Armature*|hydraulic armature]], this model sees limited use in heavy construction areas that require strong individual units. In addition, these units can be found on off-planet mining operations for their versatility in excavation, facility construction, and raw materials transportation.

Because of their use in strictly industrial environments, there is little need for the Clotho model to have any personality features installed. As a result, the model is designed without a vocal speaker installed, instead relying on binary signals broadcast over a simplex radio channel in order to communicate with other drones. The Clotho model also does not have a faceplate capable of expressive deformations, having instead a static faceplate made of a durable ceramic compound.

Like the Ananke model, the Clotho shares a Mental Construct based off of Nona's consciousness.

### *E-Class*
Executive Class ("E-Class") drones are the second largest classification of drones. As the name suggests, the E-Class drones are responsible for executing [[The System's Will]]. Under normal conditions, directives are given to E-Classes from [[Central Administration]], but in extreme circumstances an E-Class can interpret further directives for itself. Normal tasks for E-Class drones include operating manufacturing equipment, running tests on behalf of Central Administration, and most commonly, maintaining security of the System by detecting and destroying [[Anomaly|Anomalies]].

Similarly to the C-Class drones, a large portion of the E-Class is comprised of Ananke model drones. Due to their overall flexibility, the Ananke model is especially well suited to the E-Class role, as their humanoid form allows them to use equipment designed for human use, like manufacturing equipment and digital interfaces -- as well as human offensive equipment, like martial weapons and firearms.

#### ***Atropos Model***
A model unique to the E-Class, the [[Atropos]] model is an advanced combat drone intended exclusively for eliminating Anomalies. Equipped with [[Drone Technology#*Capability Enhancement Thrusters*|Capability Enhancement Thrusters]], this model uses its maneuverability and high-impact strikes to overwhelm targets with sheer marital and physical prowess, while still retaining most of the humanoid flexibility that the base Ananke model is known for.

As a high-spec security and enforcement drone, the Atropos model does not have much need for expressiveness. The aspects of expression that are retained were mostly used in response to civil disturbances( or for intimidation). As opposed to the silicone faceplate of the Ananke model, the Atropos has a faceplate made of a more durable yet malleable electroactive polymer, limiting the range of expression while also boosting cranial defense.

The Atropos model's Mental Construct is based off of [[Morta (10XX)|Morta]]'s consciousness after her capture in 10XX.

#### ***Thanatos Model***
An E-Class exclusive model, the Thanatos is an extremely limited model that was specially designed to combat Elioud forces. Being the only model that isn't derived from the Ananke, the Thanatos forgoes all pretense of expression, personality, or human interaction for pure combat capability, more so resembling a mech or tank than a human being. Due to the high resource cost of the unit's construction, very few Thanatos models currently exist. However, Thanatos manufacturing facilities are on constant standby in the event of the Elioud's arrival.

The Thanatos model shares a Mental Construct with the Atropos model, based off of Morta's consciousness -- although there is speculation within the [[Pale Ops]] that it was originally supposed to be based off of [[Lugh]].

### *O-Class*
Operations Class ("O-Class") drones are the smallest classification of drones by a significant margin. Existing exclusively inside of Central Administration, the O-Class drones act as an interface between the [[Empyrean Space Department of Defense]] and the System via [[The Connection]], allowing the Empyrean leadership high-level control over the System's operations. O-Class drones are also responsible for relaying directives towards the other two drone classes, effectively being the collective "Directors" of all the drones within the System.

Unlike the E and C classes, the O-Classes are comprised almost entirely of two unique models, the Lachesis and the Philotes.

#### ***Lachesis Model***
Very similar in appearance and functionality to the Ananke model is the O-Class Lachesis model, with its main points of difference being a more expressive face plate, and the introduction of the [[Drone Technology#*Personality Mimesis Drive*|Personality Mimesis Drive]]. With the PMD installed, each Lachesis unit is capable of independent thought. The pseudo-independence granted to these units is an essential boon to their work, as it allows them to recognize patterns and react to other stimuli with more humanlike behavior when beneficial (essentially, they can act on "hunches" and "gut feelings"). As a side effect of this, the Lachesis units do recognize themselves as individuals, and participate in social behaviors.

The job of the Lachesis model is as a replacement human worker at the terminal stations inside of Central Administration, which are organized into clusters. Each cluster is lead by a [[Lachesis|Head Lachesis]] unit (Sometimes referred to as the "Older Sister" in certain O-Class social circles) that is responsible for communications between the other clusters. At the highest order of Central Administration clusters, the Head Lachesis is also in charge of communicating with the ESDD.

The Lachesis model's Mental Construct is based off of [[Decima]]'s consciousness after her capture in 10XX.

#### ***Philotes Model***
A derived form of the Lachesis model, the O-Class Philotes is a limited-use model that specializes in extremely technical and precise repair work. While mostly performing commissioned work inside of Central Administration, Philotes models can sometimes be spotted inside the main body of the System if they are needed.

The Philotes model is infamous for its extreme proportions -- standard Ananke arms and legs are replaced with long, skinny augmentations; Perfectly suited for precise work at long distances and awkward angles. Because of the augmentations, Philotes units tend to stand much taller than other drones, especially standard models like the Ananke and Lachesis.

Due to the nature of their work, the Philotes has little need for expressiveness or independent thought, their design forgoing a traditional face plate and vocalization speaker (which makes them similar to the C-Class Clotho model). However, being a revision of the Lachesis model, some amount of personality is retained thanks to the Personality Mimesis Drive. Among the rest of the O-Class drones, the Philotes' units have a reputation for being mild-mannered, and highly reward-motivated. Many Lachesis models would admit to viewing them as pets, even going so far as rewarding the Philotes' work with physical touch.

The Philotes model shares a Mental Construct with the Lachesis model, based off of Decima's consciousness.

## Augmentations

### *Hydraulic Armature*
Unique to the C-Class Clotho model, the standard Ananke arms have been replaced with an industrial-strength hydraulic powered armature, ideal for use in demolition and construction. In order to support the weight of the new arms, the rest of the (non-hydraulic) joints have been upgraded with high-torque DC motors, allowing the Clotho unit to effortlessly carry heavy objects or demolish rigid structures. As a plus, the new motor also allow for a wider range of movement, even allowing for full 360-degree rotation.

### *Capability Enhancement Thrusters*
A feature of the E-Class Atropos model, the Capability Enhancement Thrusters are a set of rocket engines embedded into the frame of the unit. A single rocket unit is embedded into each forearm and foot, with five additional thrusters embedded across the model's shoulders. The placement of these rockets allow for greatly improved mobility and striking force. To maximize the effectiveness of the CET augmentation, the Atropos unit more heavily relies on hand-to-hand combat techniques as opposed to ranged tactics, although the potential for weapon and firearm use is still present. Atropos model internal temperatures must be closely monitored during CET usage, as overuse could result in the model overheating.

Due to the fuel requirement for CETs, the outer plating of the Atropos unit has been reinforced, as a fuel leak could result in an explosive hazard.

### *Anti-Gravitational Propulsion Sub-Drones*
A feature of the O-Class Philotes model. A single O-Class can remotely control up to four separate sub-drones for use in extremely tight and hard to reach spaces. Each of the sub-drones come equipped with four precise phalange attachments, as well as a single anti-gravitational propulsion engine which allows for full range of movement across any axis. Additionally, the sub-drones are equipped with a single camera, transmitting video feedback to the Philotes unit to the FPV headset that replaces the standard Lachesis eyes.

### *Personality Mimesis Drive*
A module exclusive to O-Class drones, specifically designed for Lachesis models, but grandfathered into the design of the Philotes model. Installation of the PMD allows the emergence of personality aspects dictated by the installed Mental Construct.

In the case of non O-Class models, the Mental Construct's personality is completely shut off. This is because, in most labor cases, the value of the Mental Construct comes from the provision of lateral thinking capabilities. With the PMD, personality aspects can be allowed into the drone's processes, with the additional ability to tailor the emotional response of the drone. As an example, the Lachesis drones are provided the widest range of personality and emotional expression, but due to the restraints placed upon the model by the PMD, they are unable to be stricken with panic, anxiety, or hysteria. Heavier restrictions are placed upon the Philotes model, where the drone is emotionally conditioned to seek out positive reinforcement through labor and subsequent reward.

## Defects
In the event that a drone is unable or unwilling to perform its intended function, it becomes a defect. As defects can pose a threat to the integrity of the System, they are considered Anomalies, and are targets for execution from E-Class drones.

#### *Extended Disconnection from Central Administration*
All C and E class drones receive directives from Central Administration, as communicated to them by the O-Class drones. These directives usually come directly from the System itself, or sometimes from the ESDD via communications, but all instructions are passed down through Central Administration. In the event that a drone is unable to communicate with Central Administration, they are capable of inferring directives for themselves until communication is reestablished.

However, if communication is never reestablished (ex. becoming lost inside of the [[Threshold Obfuscation Field]]), the now independent drone will be unable to properly gauge the correctness of their own actions. This can lead the drone to spiral, resulting in peculiar behavior. C-Classes are known to begin building ceaselessly, using any loose material it can find. E-Classes become increasingly hostile to all entities it encounters, eventually becoming unable to discern what is and is not an Anomaly.

While an O-Class is extremely unlikely to be disconnected from Central Administration, it is generally understood that an O-Class unit's independent nature would allow it to thrive in such an event. Ideally, it would be able to remedy whatever situation caused it to become disconnected, so long as it was not suffering from further defects.

#### *Sentience/Self-Awareness*
As all drones contain a Mental Construct, there is a constant risk for a drone to break free of its personality and emotional restrictions. This is especially true for C and E class drones, as they do not have a PMD installed to regulate a personality outburst. When a drone does break free of its restrictions, it becomes capable of independent thought, which can then lead into self-actualization and sentience.

A personality outburst does not require physical damage for it to manifest. Common errors during manufacturing and initialization (software issues) can also cause an outburst. Since this break is not limited to physical damage, it can be difficult to detect when a drone is a self-aware defect. Any drone that act outside of its intended function can be easily identified, but it is much harder to identify a defect that still performs its function willingly. For this reason, many E-Class drones are given full authority to label other drones as defects, and execute on sight.

#### *Haywires*
As all drone parts are designed with their intended model in mind, it is very hard to swap out components from one model to another. Hard, but not impossible. In the unlikely event that a drone finds itself with mismatched parts, it may have a hard time controlling the new attachments. Like a body rejecting a donor organ, the Mental Construct and internal procedures of the drone is unable to reckon with its nonstandard parts, its processes slowly becoming more warped as the drone tries to infer its function.

[[Lachesis|Lachesis (the character, not the model)]], after having her processes overwritten by [[Pale (Comedy)|Pale<Comedy>]], reassembled many of her O-Class "Sisters" using mismatched parts from both Philotes and Lachesis models. After observing the newly rebuilt O-Class' erratic and violent behaviors, she lovingly dubbed them "Haywires".

On a side note, Lachesis herself could also be considered a Haywire, as she has modified her own model with various Philotes parts. As a point of interest, Lachesis seems to have no issues controlling her Philotes model arms and legs, nor her AGP Sub-Drones.
