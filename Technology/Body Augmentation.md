## Improved Tolerance Electrolyte Absorption 
<sup>**Simplified Name:** *Electrolyte*</sup>
[[Red]]'s ability.

uuuh just remember that there are industrial use electrolytes in compunds like saltpeter and sodium chlorite (NOT chloride)

## Magnetic Confinement Plasma Blade
[[Plasma]]'s ability.

magnetic force can be used to confine and shape plasma (this is real) so basically its just a magnet-powered lightsaber

## SPSM-Based Cellular Macromolecule Generator
[[Polymer]]'s ability.

SPSM refers to [[Sub-Planck Spatial Manipulation]]. "Macromolecule" is a fancy way to say "polymer" in reference to hard plastic-y matter.

so basically it teleports in raw matter from... somewhere. to make anything.

## Concentrated Bioluminescent Particle Emitter
[[Photon]]'s ability.

can fire lasers out of your body. FINALLY something easy to understand

## Electroactive Hypodermic Implant Armor
[[Adrian]]'s ability.

"electroactive" refers to the ability to change shape or property based on electrical stimuli

nanomachines, son.

## Reinforced Centrifugal Impact Endoskeleton
[[Morta]]'s ability.

you basically have a super tough skeleton filled with some kind of ferrofluid or gyro. it uses the centrifugal (NOT centripetal) force generated from throwing punches, kicks, etc. to make those impacts hit a lot harder.

think of how selene from underworld or neo from the matrix sequels can flip through the air kind of unnaturally (bc IRL they're strung up on wires). looks cool
