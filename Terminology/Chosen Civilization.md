# Chosen Civilization
The term "Chosen Civilization" refers to an intelligent life form or species that [[The Author]] has "chosen". "Chosen" in this context means that the society in question is fated -- directly, or through a proxy such as [[The System]] in the case of Humans -- to build and execute the functions of the [[Placenta of the Fourth]]. 

As this is a designation that is made by an omnipotent and omnipresent entity,[[The Four Immortal Beings]] are the only ones that are truly aware of this rule. Upon the [[Universal Cycle|creation of a new universe]], the Immortals take on the form of the Chosen Civilization -- hence why [[Red]], [[Black]], and [[Pale]] have humanoid forms. [[White]] is exempt from this rule as they did not perish during the last rebirth, but are given human form upon their next death.

In the [[Previous Cycles|previous cycle]], the Chosen Civilization was the [[Elioud]]. In the current universe, it is the Humans.
