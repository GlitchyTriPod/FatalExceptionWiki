# The System's Will
"The System's Will" (or sometimes, "The Will of the System") is a term used by [[System Drones]] to describe the underlying logic behind [[The System]]'s core processes.

One way to understand the term is to consider the [Freudian model of psychoanalysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego_and_superego), where [[The Connection]] would act as the ego and [[Central Administration]] the superego. In this example, the "System's Will" would be the Id -- the part of the psyche that is the unconscious source of all needs. As the Id of the system has no inherent means or organization by which to execute its desires, it needs an external actor in order to achieve fulfillment.

Without the Connection to direct the System, and without Central Administration to productively organize its efforts, the System will either grind to a halt, or go down a path towards self-destruction.
