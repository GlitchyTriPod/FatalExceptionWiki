# Death and Immortality
Death, definitionally, means the end of life for a person or organism. While "death" in its normal understanding is still present, the mechanics of "how" and "why" depend on [[Pale]].

As Pale is the avatar of Death, their presence in the universe means that Death exists; That, at the end of life, there is death. And so, people and organisms can "end". By removing (killing) Pale -- by bringing death (an end) to Death -- life can no longer end; That even dying doesn't bring an "end". 

As a result of this phenomena, so long as Pale remains dead, nobody can truly die. Instead, their existence gets re-instanced (re-spawned, essentially), in another part of the world. There is some logic to this re-spawning, as [[Elioud]] tend to re-spawn aboard [[The Apollyon]], and humans re-spawn on Earth. Study of this logic leads to the development of [[Tether]] technologies, where the respawn point of a being can be set, or items can be summoned to a location upon their user's death.

A note: [[The Four Immortal Beings]] are considered "Immortal" because they already exist apart from Death. Once Pale is killed, all other living beings experience death they same way they do.

The only way to undo Pale's death is to execute the function of the [[Placenta of the Fourth]], resurrecting Pale -- and [[Universal Cycle|bringing Death to the universe]].
