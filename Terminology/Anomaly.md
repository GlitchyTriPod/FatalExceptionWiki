# Anomaly
"Anomaly" is a term used by inhabitants of [[The System]] to describe entities that exist outside of the System's standard protocols.  In its most common use-case, "Anomaly" is used as a label against trespassers inside of the System, most often humans crossing through [[The Threshold]], [[Malnova Tero|human settlements inside of the System]], or potential detection of [[Elioud]]. This denotation is normally issued by [[Central Administration]], and used by [[System Drones#E-Class|E-Class Drones]] when identifying targets for execution. It could also be used to identify [[System Drones#Defects|drone defects]], or other System agents that Central Administration deems unneeded/requiring elimination.

After the destruction of the [[Placenta of the Fourth|Placenta]] and [[Central Administration (Location)|Central Administration]], there no longer exists a centralized authoritative body for the identification of Anomalies. As a result, the "Anomaly" label is applied wantonly by defected drones [[Lachesis]] and [[Atropos]].
